--> ReactJS Lover and Computer Science enthusiast. I'm definitely a visual person and frontend appeals to that. But I like backend sometimes too, because I’m at my happiest when I don't need to even open a browser. I also like dealing with data, API integration and SQL stored process. I keep track of libraries and tools that help me do a better job. I love to learn new things and skills and I also believe in learning more about new things every day, it fascinate me to explore and develop myself and with my surrounding.
